# BellyButtonMeat

The purpose of this repository was to create data visualizations for an anonymized dashboard for participants in a study. This study was to identify bateria that synthesize proteins that taste like beef. The lab is searching for these bacteria in this study's participants' belly buttons. Participants can go to our website, select their ID number from a drop-down menu, and view which bacteria their cultures yielded. Given the variabliity of washing frequency among the participants, some of the bacterial loads are... beefy. 

The data and participant information is anonymized by ID number and stored in a JSON. There are three visualizations using Plotly: one for the values of the top ten bacterial species found, one for self-reported washing frequency, and a bubble visualization, scaling the bacteria found with the amount of bacteria found. 

I had some fun customizing the formatting, including making the page's background flesh toned, and adding an image of a naval to the header in the jumbotron.
